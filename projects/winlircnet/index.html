If a DLL or an EXE cannot find its corresponding CONFIG files, the component may fail to function properly. The files WinLIRC.Test.dll and WinLIRC.Test.dll.config are necessary if you’re planning to perform unit testing using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2010. The files WinLIRC.Debug.exe and WinLIRC.Debug.exe.config are required only for testing and debugging purposes – testing WinLIRC.NET signal transmitter and receiver. The WinLIRC.NET configuration editor, WinLIRC.Configuration.Editor.exe is required only for generate WinLIRC.NET remote control configuration file from WinLIRC remote configuration file. Once and only when WinLIRC.NET configuration file is generated and loaded by WinLIRC.NET transmitter and receiver daemon, WinLIRC.NET is fully functional. The file WinLIRC.NET.dll contains core framework functionality which is accessed by both WLN transmitter and receiver daemon.</p>
				<p align="justify">It is not recommended to deploy any unnecessary files/components in production environment.</p>
				<b>Installation and Configuration Procedure</b>
				</br>
				</br>
				<b>Step #1: Acquisition of files</b>

				<ul>
					<li>WinLIRC.NET.dll</li>
					<li>WinLIRC.Messages.dll</li>
					<li>WinLIRC.Configuration.dll</li>
				</ul>
				Syntax:				
				<ul>
					<li>gacutil.exe -i [full path to DLL]</li>
				</ul>
				Commands:
				<ul>
					<li>gacutil.exe -i [full path to DLL WinLIRC.NET.dll]</li>
					<li>gacutil.exe -i [full path to DLL WinLIRC.Messages.dll]</li>
					<li>gacutil.exe -i [full path to DLL WinLIRC.Configuration.dll]</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Step #3: Registering Windows Services</b>
				<p align="justify">Register WLN transmitter (WinLIRC.Transmitter.Daemon.exe) and receiver daemon (WinLIRC.Receiver.Daemon.exe) services to system services using sc.exe provided in any of WLN supported Microsoft Windows platform. By default, the Windows service would be registered to run under LOCALSYSTEM system account in Manual startup mode. This can be changed to run any system/user account of appropriate privilege in Automatic mode using Windows Services Microsoft Management Console (MMC).</p>
				Syntax:
				<ul>
					<li>sc.exe create [windows service name] binPath=[whitespace][full path to windows service executable]</li>
				</ul>
				Commands:
				<ul>
					<li>sc.exe create WinLIRC.NET-Transmitter binPath=[whitespace][full path to WinLIRC.Transmitter.Daemon.exe]</li>
					<li>sc.exe create WinLIRC.NET-Transmitter binPath=[whitespace][full path to WinLIRC.Receiver.Daemon.exe]</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Step #4: Creating Microsoft Messaging Queues</b>
				<p align="justify">Create two non-transactional private MSMQs with sufficient privileges to read and write by the WinLIRC.NET transmitter and receiver daemon, using Microsoft Messaging Management Console - one for WinLIRC.NET transmitter to send outbound IR signals from WinLIRC.NET infrastructure to WinLIRC (e.g. winlirc_send) and one for WinLIRC.NET receiver to receive inbound IR signal from WinLIRC into WinLIRC infrastructure (e.g. winlirc_recv).</p>
				<b>Step #5: Building WLN Remote Control Configuration</b>
				<p align="justify">Create a WLN configuration file (a XML file) for the desired remote control using WLN Configuration Editor, WinLIRC.Configuration.Editor.exe from WinLIRC remote control configuration file. WLN Configuration Editor facilitates mapping for remote control keys from WinLIRC to WLN.</p>

					<li>Locate the WLN remote configuration file and update its full path in the RemoteKeys attribute.</li>
					<li>Add/remove/clear applications under Applications XML tag as needed.</li>
					<li>Update ID attribute with a unique GUID for every application configured.</li>
					<li>Update the MSMQ path for every application desired to communicate with WLN and transmit IR signals.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Step #7: Configuration Receiver</b>
				<p align="justify">Open WLN receiver daemon configuration file (WinLIRC.Receiver.Daemon.exe.config) and update the following in settings XML tag under Configuration - as required and needed.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Specify WinLIRC port number in Port attribute. By default, WinLIRC sends out decoded IR signals at the port number 8765.</li>
					<li>Locate the WLN remote configuration file and update its full path in the RemoteKeys attribute.</li>
					<li>Add/remove/clear applications under Applications XML tag as needed.</li>
					<li>Update ID attribute with a unique GUID for every application configured.</li>
					<li>Update the MSMQ path for every application desired to communicate with WLN and transmit IR signals.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Step #8: Starting up Transmitter and Receiver</b>
				<p align="justify">Start WLN transmitter and receiver using Windows Services Microsoft Management Console. Change the services startup mode to Automatic if required to let the services startup during system startup automatically.</p>
				<b>Step #9: Testing Transmitter and Receiver</b>
				<p align="justify">Open WNL Debug configuration file (WinLIRC.Debug.exe.config ) and update the setting WinLIRC_TransmitterQueue and WinLIRC_ReceiverQueue with the full path of the created signal transmitter and receiver MSMQ. Execute WLN Debug (WinLIRC.Debug.exe) and open signal transmitter and receiver. Start the receiver, send a signal using transmitter and verify is the same signal is received by the receiver. Ensure that you execute WLN Debug signal transmitter in the machine where WLN transmitter daemon is installer and WLN Debug signal receiver in the machine where WLN receiver daemon is installed and properly configured to wire up each other.</p>
				<b>Step #10: Using WLN Messages</b>

				<br />
				<b>How to check if WinLIRC is decoding and receiving IR signals?</b>
				<p align="justify">In Windows platform, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and telnet to WinLIRC port. By default, WinLIRC sends all decoded IR signals at the port 8765.</p>
				<br />
				<h4 id="faq"><b>FAQ</b></h4>
				<br />
				<b>What is IR?</b>
				<p align="justify">Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength longer than that of visible light, measured from the nominal edge of visible red light at 0.74 micrometers, and extending conventionally to 300 micrometers. These wavelengths correspond to a frequency range of approximately 1 to 400THz and include most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature. Microscopically, IR light is typically emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements.

				<b>What is a transceiver?</b>
				<p align="justify">A transceiver is a device that has both a transmitter and receivers which are combined and share common circuitry or a single housing. If no circuitry is common between transmit and receive functions, the device is a transmitter-receiver. The term originated in the early 1920s. Technically, transceivers must combine a significant amount of the transmitter and receiver handling circuitry.
